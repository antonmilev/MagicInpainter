# Introduction

<b>MagicInpainter</b> is image processing tool for inpaint, mask selection and objects removal of small and medium sized objects. It uses optimized GPU image processing algorithms for inpaint.

<p>Inpaint</p> (or image reconstruction) is a process of filling in the missing parts of images in a natural way, preserving textures and background so that a person is not able to spot the difference. 

There are two main groups of modern image inpaint methods:

<ul>
<li>image processing algorithms (called also traditional)</li>
<li>deep learning using neural networks with CNNs, etc. (called also AI methods)</li>
</ul>
